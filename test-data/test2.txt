Describing their defining characteristics, typical altitudes, and how they're formed would be super helpful for me.
One of the big questions in philosophy is whether we truly have free will or if all of our actions are predetermined by prior causes based on the laws of nature. I've read about different views like hard determinism, libertarian free will, and compatibilism, but I'm still really struggling to wrap my head around this issue. Can you lay out the key arguments and perspectives surrounding the problem of free will in a way that's relatively easy to understand?
There's a lot of talk about shifting away from fossil fuels toward renewable energy like solar, wind, hydroelectric, etc. But how viable and efficient are these alternative sources? What are the pros and cons of each? Can renewable energy realistically meet our growing global energy needs or are there limitations? I'd appreciate your objective take on the potential and tradeoffs of renewables as replacements for oil, gas and coal.

I'd appreciate a factual, well-rounded perspective on this controversial but crucial issue.
I'm really fascinated by cosmology and have been reading about the Big Bang theory, which says the universe began as an incredibly hot, dense singularity that inflated outward. But there's still a lot of mystery around what came before or caused the Big Bang in the first place. Can you walk me through the key elements of the Big Bang model and the lines of evidence that support it? I'd also love to learn about some of the open questions and alternative theories in cosmology as well.
With the billions of galaxies and potentially habitable planets in the universe, many scientists think alien life must exist. But if that's the case, why haven't we encountered other intelligent civilizations yet? This seems like a contradiction, which I believe is referred to as the 'fermi paradox.' From your perspective, what are some of the potential explanations that have been proposed for this paradox? What solutions or arguments do you find most plausible when it comes to the possibility of extraterrestrial intelligence?
I've read about things like militarism, imperialism, nationalism, and the alliance system as potential causes of WWI, but I'm still a bit confused about how these factors actually led to the outbreak of war in 1914. Can you walk me through the sequence of events and explain how these underlying tensions and rivalries among the great powers eventually spiraled into a global conflict?
With all the hacking, identity theft, and cyber attacks these days, I'm really concerned about keeping my online data and accounts secure.

How can individual investors analyze market conditions and make informed decisions about when to buy, sell or hold? Any tips for a beginner investor would be great.
I've heard the term 'survival of the fittest' associated with evolution, but I'm not totally clear on what it means. Natural selection is supposed to filter out unfavorable traits, right? But how exactly does this process work? Could you give me an overview of the core mechanisms driving evolution by natural selection as proposed by Darwin and our current understanding of it?
I have a hard time wrapping my head around Einstein's theory of general relativity. The concepts of gravity influencing the fabric of spacetime and mass causing distortions just seem so counterintuitive. Can you give me an overview of what general relativity is proposing and how it differs from our classic Newtonian understanding of gravity? Some intuitive examples or thought experiments to conceptualize it would be great too.
I find the human brain fascinating yet incredibly complex. It's amazing that this biological organ gives rise to our consciousness, thoughts, emotions, memories and more.

I'd love a high-level look at this vexing philosophical puzzle.
I've heard the 'dark web' discussed a lot in ominous tones, often portrayed as this underground playground for illegal activity. But I'm a bit confused - what actually is the dark web? How is it different from the normal Internet we use? Is it truly as nefarious as it's made out to be, or is there legitimate reason for its existence? I could use some clarification on this mysterious underworld of the Internet.
I've heard pretty wild stories about people who temporarily died but then came back, describing things like out-of-body sensations, seeing bright lights or deceased relatives, having their life 'flash before their eyes,' and so on. But how can we explain these near-death experiences scientifically? Are they just products of brain chemistry and hallucinatory activity? Or could something more profound be happening that we don't understand? I'm really intrigued to get your perspective on this.
I've heard some modern physics theories propose the radical idea of a 'multiverse' with multiple separate universes existing in parallel. But I have a really hard time wrapping my head around what that truly means and how it's possible. Can you try to explain the multiverse concept and the scientific principles that give rise to this idea of countless realities? Some intuitive analogies or thought experiments to visualize it better would be super helpful.
I recently learned about this phenomenon called the 'Mandela Effect' where massive groups of people seem to share the same distorted memory about something, even though the reality appears to be different. Like many people being confident Nelson Mandela died in prison in the 1980s, when in fact he lived until 2013. It's so bizarre! Can you shed some light on what scientists and psychologists think could be behind these widespread incidences of shared misremembering? I'm really stumped!
I've heard about the 'placebo effect' in medicine, where a fake treatment with no actual therapeutic properties can sometimes still produce positive results if the patient thinks it's real. But that seems so counterintuitive to me - how can a completely inert placebo trigger real improvements or healing? What's the scientific explanation here? I'd love for you to help demystify this weird effect for me.
I've heard physicists discuss elementary particles like quarks, leptons, bosons and more, but I struggle to comprehend what these actually are.
